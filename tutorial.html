          <p>
            Rare Fish Trade is a game about buying and selling (fake) fish in a
            highly volatile market. The game can be played for as long as you
            want; the goal is to earn as much in-game cash as possible. You
            start the game with no money, only a single fish.
          </p>
          <h5>Market</h5>
          <p>
            To earn more money, you need to watch the market page, which
            displays the prices of each type of fish in the game. The prices
            continually update at a regular interval, and can get better or
            worse as time goes on. View the different types of fish on the left
            by scrolling through their listings, and hit the trade button to
            sell fish you have or buy new ones. The graph in the right displays
            the prices of each fish over time. Most fish investors know the best
            way to make money is to sell their fish when the price is higher
            than usual, and use the earned cash to invest in a different fish
            that is at a lower price than usual. Smarter investors will watch
            the market for trends and use that information to make the wisest
            purchases.
          </p>
          <h5>Collection</h5>
          <p>
            The collection is the best way to view your current money and
            display your fish. You can click the facts button to learn
            interesting trivia about the fish you currently own.
          </p>
          <h5>Settings</h5>
          <p>
            You can change the speed and volatility of the market at any time
            for a more relaxed or intense experience.
